This repository contains the initial structures of the membrane bilayer and Python codes used to derive CV using the SPIB protocol for the paper "Structural Heterogeneity of the Membrane-Interacting Region of the HIV-1 Envelope Glycoprotein" by Ayan Majumder and Gregory A. Voth

The SPIB code was adapted from https://github.com/tiwarylab/State-Predictive-Information-Bottleneck

In this study, we used pytorch and libtorch version 1.13.1+. To compile plumed with pytorch/libtorch, please follow the instructions on:https://www.plumed.org/doc-master/user-doc/html/_p_y_t_o_r_c_h__m_o_d_e_l.html
